BattleSpeech for Windows 10

It's a voice-controlled Battleship game called BattleSpeech. It doesn't do much right now, but it sets up a grid and places a random gray rectangle (the ship) and allows you to call out your attack position.

If you have time to test, here are the instructions.
1. Launch BattleSpeech app.
2. Click the Cortana mic icon on Windows 10.
3. Say "BattleSpeech Attack Row [r] Column [c]" where r and c can range from 1-4

Todo:
* Hide ships when game launches
* Allow user to toggle ship visibility
* Detect when attack falls on a ship
* Add animations
* Add multiplayer
* Make pretty :-)

Feel free to suggest new features, as I continue to make progress. Make sure you have the latest version of Windows 10 and Visual Studio 2015 with Win10 dev tools.
